Generic error/exception type; should generally be used anywhere we want to
terminate program execution and display an error message to the user. Runtime
introspection allows errors to report information about where in the code they
were raised and what values/types the problematic object(s) had, in certain
circumstances. Some of the included exceptions are based on those from
https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html.
