# finch

*Fast, good, and cheap*

Finch is a general-purpose, multiparadigm programming language that draws
inspiration from Rust, Lisp, and Python, among several other languages. It aims
to be a highly capable choice for both high-level and low-level projects
spanning many different applications; and to support a wide range of coding
styles and environments without sacrificing quality, efficiency, or developer
experience.

It is not yet ready for practical use; I aim to release the first stable
version of Finch by January 2023 (subject to change). My goal is to have a
reasonably complete reference implementation in Rust within the next few
months, though further (substantial) changes are still a possibility ater that
point.
