# finch

*Fast, good, and cheap*

Finch is a general-purpose, multiparadigm programming language that draws
inspiration from Rust, Lisp, and Python, among several other languages. It aims
to be a highly capable choice for both high-level and low-level projects
spanning many different applications; and to support a wide range of coding
styles and environments without sacrificing quality, efficiency, or developer
experience.

It is not yet ready for practical use; I aim to release the first stable
version of Finch by January 2023 (subject to change). My goal is to have a
reasonably complete reference implementation in Rust within the next few
months, though further (substantial) changes are still a possibility ater that
point.

My hope is for Finch to be usable (and enjoyable) in all of the below settings,
among others:

- Systems programming
- Scripting and automation
- Mathematics (both numerical and symbolic)
- Application programming
- Machine learning and artificial intelligence
- Statistics
- Text processing and data science
- Web development
- Markup and templating

That said, there are certainly many areas where it *doesn't* aim to act as a
replacement for any existing standards; for example, the current Finch design
plan includes a fairly substantial runtime, so a compact and fully compiled
language like Rust might be a better choice for embedded applications.
