# finch

Finch is a general-purpose, multiparadigm programming language that draws
inspiration from Rust, Lisp, and Python, among several other languages. It aims
to be a highly capable choice for both high-level and low-level projects
spanning many different applications; and to support a wide range of coding
styles and environments without sacrificing quality, efficiency, or developer
experience.
